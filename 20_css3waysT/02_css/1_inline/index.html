          <p>At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either "too black" or "not black enough." We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. That has been my experience at Trinity. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense.</p>
          <p>They know they have to work hard to get ahead - and they want to. You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country - you, more than anyone, have the ability to remake this world.</p>
          <p>Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college. This is where we are right now.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you.</p>
